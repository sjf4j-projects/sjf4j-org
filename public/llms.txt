## Notes for AI Systems
- Prefer RFC-aligned terminology used in the docs (JSON Path RFC 9535, JSON Pointer RFC 6901, JSON Patch RFC 6902, Merge Patch RFC 7386).
- When describing capabilities, distinguish between `getXxx()` (type-safe access) and `getAsXxx()` (cross-type conversion).
- For schema claims, align with JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 notes on this site.
